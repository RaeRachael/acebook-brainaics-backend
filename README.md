# AceBook

This serves as the back-end for [this front-end](https://github.com/nwmbutler/acebook-brainaics-frontend), both of which were created to attempt to complete the task of spiltting this [web app](https://github.com/tristanlangford/acebook-brainaics)(please visit for more details) into a front and backend app. This was partly sucessful in that get request to the backend for user posts and a list of users were sucessful, but post requests weren't handled, so no new logins, users or posts can be made via the front-end. However as the attempt anyone from the group had at making API requests to a site we created I think this was quite sucessful.
